# Event Preprocessing System Design

## Overview
The event preprocessing system provides a flexible framework for transforming and enriching events before they reach the main event processors. This design is particularly important for handling events that require sequential processing or state management, such as CandleEvents.

## Core Components

### 1. EventPreProcessor Base Class
The foundation of the preprocessing system is the abstract base class that defines the preprocessing interface:

```python
class EventPreProcessor(ABC, Generic[T, U]):
    @abstractmethod
    def preprocess_event(self, event: T) -> U:
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def reset(self) -> None:
        pass
```

### 2. State Management
Dedicated state classes manage preprocessor-specific state, exemplified by the CandleState class:

- Maintains previous event data
- Handles timezone conversions
- Implements memory management
- Provides state reset capabilities

### 3. Specialized Preprocessors

#### SequencePreProcessor
- Ensures events are processed in correct sequence order
- Buffers out-of-sequence events
- Maintains sequence state per symbol
- Particularly important for market data integrity

#### CandlePreProcessor
- Enriches basic candle events with previous candle data
- Manages timezone conversions
- Maintains historical state
- Example of stateful event enrichment

## Event Flow

### 1. Message Reception
- EventHandler receives raw messages
- Messages are parsed into basic events

### 2. Preprocessing Chain
- Events pass through preprocessor chain in defined order
- For CandleEvents:
  1. SequencePreProcessor ensures correct order
  2. CandlePreProcessor enriches with historical data

### 3. Event Processing
Preprocessed events are passed to main processors. Each event is guaranteed to be:

- In correct sequence
- Enriched with required data
- Properly formatted

## CandleEvent Example

### Basic Flow
```
BasicCandleEvent → SequencePreProcessor → CandlePreProcessor → CandleEvent
```

### State Requirements

#### 1. Sequence State
- Tracks event sequence numbers per symbol
- Buffers out-of-sequence events
- Ensures market data consistency

#### 2. Candle State
- Stores previous candle data per symbol
- Manages timezone conversions
- Implements memory bounds
- Provides historical context

### Enrichment Process

#### 1. Sequence Validation
- Check event sequence number
- Buffer if out of sequence
- Release when sequence complete

#### 2. Data Enrichment
- Add previous candle data
- Format timestamps
- Convert timezones
- Maintain state

## Implementation Considerations

### Memory Management
- Bounded storage for previous candles
- Cleanup of old sequence buffers
- State reset capabilities

### Error Handling
- Missing sequence numbers
- Invalid timestamps
- State corruption
- Memory limits

### Performance
- Efficient state lookups
- Minimal memory footprint
- Quick sequence validation

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Batch Preprocessing**
   - Handle multiple events simultaneously
   - Optimize for high-throughput scenarios

2. **Additional Preprocessors**
   - Volume analysis
   - Price normalization
   - Custom indicators

3. **State Persistence**
   - Disk-based state backup
   - State recovery mechanisms
   - High availability support

### Monitoring Considerations
1. **Metrics**
   - Sequence gaps
   - Processing latency
   - State size
   - Memory usage

2. **Alerting**
   - Sequence violations
   - State corruption
   - Memory thresholds
   - Processing delays

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Individual preprocessor functionality
- State management
- Error conditions
- Memory bounds

### Integration Tests
- Preprocessor chain
- Event flow
- State persistence
- Error recovery

### Performance Tests
- Throughput metrics
- Memory usage
- State lookup speed
- Sequence handling

## Conclusion
The preprocessing system provides a robust foundation for handling complex event processing requirements, with CandleEvents serving as a prime example of its capabilities. The design allows for future expansion while maintaining clear separation of concerns and robust state management.
